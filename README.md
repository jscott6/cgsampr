# graphs
R package for sampling graphs conditional on vertex degrees, and additional observed data. The package allows for sampling both directed and undirected graphs, and allows users to fix particular edges/non-edges in the graph. This allows for modelling a wide spectrum of graph topologies - for example, mulitpartite graphs. 

The package provides a number of implementations, including the classic 'switch' and matching algorithms.

### Installation

The package can be installed locally using the devtools library. For example, users may download the package and install with the install_local routine of the devtools library.
