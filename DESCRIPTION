Description: This package provides efficient MCMC algorithms for uniform 
	sampling of graphs conditional on vertex level data. The algorithms use
	state dependent kernel selection to efficiently traverse the state space.
	Two settings are considered: uniform sampling from unweighted graphs 
	conditional on vertex degrees, and uniform sampling from weighted graphs
	conditional on vertex strengths. In addition, it is possible to fix an 
	arbitrary set of possible edges as present or absent in all the sampled graphs.
